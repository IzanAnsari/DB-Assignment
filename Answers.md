Answer 1 = Relationship between "Product" and "Product_Category" entities:
The relationship between "Product" and "Product_Category" entities is likely a foreign key relationship. The "Product" entity has a field named category_id, which is an integer representing the category to which the product belongs. This field is likely a foreign key referencing the id field in the "Product_Category" entity. This means that each product is associated with a specific category through the category_id foreign key.

Answer 2 = Ensuring each product has a valid category:
To ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it, you can enforce the foreign key constraint on the category_id field. This constraint would ensure that the value in the category_id field of the "Product" table must match a valid id in the "Product_Category" table. This can be achieved by setting up a foreign key relationship between the two tables, which will prevent the insertion of a product with a non-existent or invalid category.

In SQL, the foreign key constraint can be applied as follows:
ALTER TABLE Product
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_category
FOREIGN KEY (category_id)
REFERENCES Product_category(id);
